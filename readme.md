## Important Notes
#### ðŸ”’ API Key Security:
- We cannot provide our OpenAI API key directly due to security reasons.
- We cannot provide direct access to our fine-tuned model due to OpenAI's restrictions (only model owners can access fine-tuned models).
- You must use your own OpenAI API key and base models (e.g., gpt-4o, o3-mini).
#### ðŸš€ Model Selection:
- Use OpenAI's base models for analysis. You may choose more powerful models like o3-mini if available under your account.
- Example options: gpt-4o, gpt-4o-mini.
